# CoordinatePlaneOutlierDetector
Uses Standard Deviation, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Angle-based Outlier Detector (ABOD) to discover outliers in an x-y coordinate plane

# Input
- Give a file name.csv with columns of data
- Enter two titles of columns with data that represent x and y variables
- Enter title of column that labels the points (x,y)

# Result
- Will give k-NN and ABOD graphs that show outliers
  - White dots represent inliers
  - Black dots represent outliers
- Can use standard deviation (provided in code) to confirm/cross-check outliers
